# CMAppUtil-Helper

This is our last release of the CMAppUtil Helper. To give others the chance to make it better we make the code pubicly available. Its not polished as it should as it was a rather quick & dirty implementation. But it does its job.

CMAppUtil is a small tool which allows SCCM Admins to create .cmmac files more easy by offering a little GUI.
The gui allows a mass creation of .cmmac files.
