# CMAppUtil-Helper

This is our last release of the CMAppUtil Helper. To give others the chance to make it better we make the code pubicly available. Its not polished as it should as it was a rather quick & dirty implementation. But it does its job.

CMAppUtil Helper provides an easy way to convert your Mac OS X native software packages into the Microsoft .cmmac format.
You are an Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager administrator and usually do the conversion of .app, .dmg etc on command line and looking for a tool which makes it easier to use CMAppUtil? This is the right app…
Just drag your file to the application window. Conversion starts instantly…

<b>Supported file formats:</b></br>
.dmg, .pkg, .mpkg, .app
 
<b>What’s new in v1.1</b></br>
Converted files are now in a folder with the name of the original file
[fixed] app or whole system hangs
